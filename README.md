=========

This is a 1.13+ fork of the official repo for the MarioKart plugin by storm345 and stormdev

The 1.16+-branch enables custom Minecart-Models!    
The dev-branch is based on the 1.16+-branch!

WILL ONLY WORK WITH UCARS 1.13+ (v1.5 following)!
(Fork for that: [uCars 1.13+](https://github.com/Jakllp/ucars))

Other requirements:
Up to v1.5.0:

Since 1.5.1:
